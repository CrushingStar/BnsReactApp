    "text": "Ever since the earliest civilizations, religion has always existed in different shapes and forms, from Shamanic dating back thousands of years to recent Protestant Churches. Although everyone has a different take on their personal religious beliefs, it is undeniable that all religions have had a significant impact on the history of mankind.\nWhen looking at a majority of mainstream religions with the greatest historical impacts today, it is reasonable to say that most of them share several core similarities. The two most blatant ones are the belief in an omniscient god and an afterworld, which can be found in Buddhism, Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, and Judaism. In fact, historians categorize religions into three overly generalized categories: animism, polytheism, and monotheism. Animism is the belief that all objects and living beings possess a spiritual essence. Animism believes animals, rocks, and natural elements all possess an individual mind. Polytheism is the belief in multiple gods and monotheism is the belief in one god.\nRegardless of what religion you may believe in, it is important to understand how religion was made. For instance, the tremendous chronicle stress of death on humans may have influenced people to believe in an afterlife, which can be interpreted as a coping strategy for sorrow, and rejection that their loved ones are lost forever. The thought of a “heaven” or an “afterlife” gives comfort to people and takes away some of the dreaded thought of death. Believing that an ideal life awaits them after death relieves them of the miseries of reality. Not only that, it makes others more likely to believe in the religion, and spread more rapidly.\nReligions were a way for ancient civilizations to explain the unexplainable. Believing that a supernatural entity controls the sky, and the stars are deceased ancestors gives more comfort to people, as certainties and constants give more stability. When one does not know why and how the world works, it physiologically makes them unsure of events that happen around them. For example, when a drought comes and crops die off, it is easier to believe that it is because a “god” is angry at them, as they have no other explanation for an event that seems random to them. Before modern sciences, people could not explain why it rained, what stars were, why the sun moved, why seasons changed, and the majority of the natural world and religion filled these empty spots of knowledge for them.\nHence, it can be argued that religions are not arbitrary cults, but an ancient way of explaining the world around them, and a way for people to cope with the harsh realities of this world and the death of loved ones. This allows us to understand why so many religions have similarities and how they have persisted throughout history and have had tremendous historical influence."
